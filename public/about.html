<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Serbia, Novi Pazar. I am 34 years old. I graduated from elementary school in my hometown, followed by a music school.
   I graduated from medical school and studied chemistry. Before creating this portfolio, I completed mobile and web design.</p>

<p>My interests are different, I like music, travel, books and girls :). One of my hobbies is the gym. I like socializing and meeting new people. As for work, I have been working in health for about 10 years, I think I am a successful and good person. especially a humane one who helped many people. 
  I am guided by the motto, if you can help someone, help someone, but never take someone away. What matters to me is what kind of person someone is, not what color, religion or nation they are.
   I decided to change my life and I will try and succeed in this area, I simply set a goal and outlined some things.</p>

<p>About two weeks ago, I designed a mobile banking application, my goal is to code and enable it when I finish the course.
